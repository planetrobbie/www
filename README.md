## About yet.org

*yet.org* was created in 2006 by *SÃ©bastien Braun*, a innovation and tech enthusiast. It originally used *[Movable Types](http://www.movabletype.org/)* and was mostly talking about Science Fiction litterature. It then evolved as a *MediaWiki* [encyclopedia](http://wiki.yet.org).

As of end of end of november 2012 a new iteration to a fully static web site was on the way, it was based on the excellent *[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/)* generator which I choosed because it's not only a blogging system but a great toolkit to build whatever comes out of your imagination. After almost 12 years running, I'm now switching to something with less dependency written in Go, Hugo. Please welcome this new *yet* makeover.

In this repository you'll find not only the code of *YET* but all the posts in MultiMarkdown format.

It's now my turn to share, feel free to re-use whatever part of *YET*.

By the way, *YET* stands for *Yet Emerging Technologies*.
