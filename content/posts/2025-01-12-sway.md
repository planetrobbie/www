I have been using the [i3](https://i3wm.org/) tiling window manager under [manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) on my Lenovo Thinkpad laptop for years, but with the replacement of X11 by [wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), I became interested in a solution compatible with this new display protocol, [Sway](https://swaywm.org/).

As I started to use it, I felt the need to summarise my findings here, especially the hotkeys, which are key to keeping your hands on the keyboard at all times.

### Other bindings

| **Description**         | **Keybinding**  |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Shortcut to Sway config | `Mod + Shift + I` |

### Arch Linux installation

```
pacman -S sway swaylock swayidle swaybg alacritty xorg-xwayland wtype
pacman -S wmenu foot # application launcher & terminal dependencies
pacman -S wayvnc # VNC server for sway
```

`seatd` is required for Wayland to give sway access to keyboard/mouse/..

```systemctl enable seatd 
systemctl start seatd
gpasswd -a <user> seat
gpasswd -a <user> video
gpasswd -a <user> input
```

#### Sway configuration
Copy the Sway default configuration to your config directory
```
cp /etc/sway/config ~/.config/sway/config
```

You can also reuse instead your i3 configuration file which is compatible with sway.

The default Mod key is the Meta/Super key.

- On a Windows keyboard, this will be the “Windows” key.
- On an Apple keyboard, this will be the “Cmd” key.

If you wish, you can change the Mod key to something else in your Sway config. In particular change the `Mod` key which should be `Mod4` if you access Sway from MacOS thru a VNC client like I'm doing.

```
vi ~/.config/sway/config 
set $mod Mod1
```

Now grab the name of your display with

```
swaymsg -t get_outputs
```

You can now edit your display configuration for example

```
output * bg /usr/share/backgrounds/sway/Sway_Wallpaper_Blue_1920x1080.png
output HEADLESS-1 resolution 1920x1200 position 0,0 
```

End the installation and configuration by reloading your configuration with `Mod + Shift + C`

You can easily remotely access using a VNC client by running the integrated server  `wayvnc <IP> 5901` and create a SSH tunnel from your client machine

```
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 <user>@<sway_srv_ip>
```

### Conclusion

Once you start using a tiling window manager, after a while you become so productive that you don't want to go back to a traditional one. Even people on MacOS are starting to use tiling window managers like [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace), [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) or [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai).
