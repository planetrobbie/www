After two years of efforts and a $300k donation to the [Zig Software Foundation](https://ziglang.org/zsf/), Mitchell Hashimoto has just announced the availability of version 1.0 of his [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) terminal emulator. He wanted Ghostty to be fast, feature-rich, and native on MacOS and Linux. I couldn’t find on the documentation a list of default key bindings for MacOS so here it is, plus some more stuff that I used extracted from the [documentation](https://ghostty.org/docs). We don't see any new terminal emulator often, so I urge you to try it out.

| ⌘=, ⌘-, ⌘0 | increase, decrease, reset font size |
| ⌘[ , ⌘] | select **previous**, **next** Split |
| ⌥⌘  ↑, ↓, →, ← | select **above, below, left, right** |
| ⌃⌘  ↑, ↓, →, ←, = | move divider **up, down, right, left or equalize** |
| ⌘↵ | Toggle fullscreen |
| ⇧⌘↵ | Zoom/Dezoom Split |
| ⌥ click | moves the cursor to the click location |
| ⌘, | edit configuration |
| ⇧⌘, | reload configuration |

## CLI examples

Ghostty can also be run on the command line to perform various actions
```bash
 ghostty +list-themes [currently: Solarized Dark Higher Contrast]
 ghostty +list-fonts
 ghostty +show-config --default --docs
```

## Installation

on MacOS

```bash
brew install --cask ghostty
```

on Archlinux

```bash
pacman -S ghostty
```

## FAQ

**Configure SSH to fall back to a known terminfo entry**

```bash
# .ssh/config
Host example.com
  SetEnv TERM=xterm-256color
```

But it would be wiser to use instead such a one liner to get all of Ghostty features

```bash
infocmp -x | ssh YOUR-SERVER -- tic -x -
```

## My Current (light)  configuration

Ghostty is advertised as a zero config terminal, I just have the following lines

```bash
# app
theme = Solarized Dark Higher Contrast
fullscreen = true
macos-titlebar-style = transparent

# window
window-padding-balance = true
window-padding-x = 4
window-padding-y = 4
window-save-state = always
focus-follows-mouse = true
unfocused-split-opacity = 0.5

# font
font-family = Monaspace Neon
font-size = 16
font-thicken = true
bold-is-bright = true

# other
clipboard-read = allow
clipboard-write = allow
shell-integration-features = cursor,sudo,no-title
mouse-hide-while-typing = true
```
