Today there is a plethora of web frameworks that use client-side javascript to create reactive websites. It has become quite difficult to choose one of them, they all look amazing and offer so many features. But in a way they hide things from you, you don't really know how it all fits together. So let us see what else we can use to build a web application. We will go back to the roots and introduce [TEMPL](https://templ.guide/), a [Go](http://golang.org) package developed by _Adrian Hesketh_ that goes beyond the standard [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) library. It's useful to create simple static web components that can be integrated into a bigger picture and served by a compiled binary. Assembling small components yourself helps to keep control of your code.

### Installation
Installing a package in Go is as simple as
```
go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
```
### A small `templ` example
Traditionaly let start by initializing a new Go module and fetching `templ`
```shell
mkdir welcome
cd welcome
# create a go.mod file to manage dependencies
# update below the unique identifier of your module
go mod init github.com/<your_handle>/welcome
# download and install templ
go get github.com/a-h/templ
```
Create your first template
```go
vi welcome.templ
package main

templ welcome(firstname string) {
<h1>Welcome to yet emerging technologies, { firstname } !</h1>
}
```
You can now **process** your template to generate Go code from it
```shell
templ generate
```
To watch current directory for changes and regenerate constantly
```shell
templ generate -watch
```
But code built like that isn't optimized for production use

You should now have a `welcome_templ.go` file containing your newly generated Go function named `welcome` with the following signature, it returns `templ.Component` an interface that has a `Render` method on it that is used to render the component to an `io.Writer`.

```go
func welcome(firstname string) templ.Component {
```
returned`templ.Component` can be called like that
```
component := welcome("Sebastien")
```
to generate the expected content wherever you want for example on `Stdout`
```
component.Render(context.Background(), os.Stdout)
```
So it looks like that
```go
package main

import (
"context"
"os"
)

func main() {
  component := welcome("Sebastien")
  component.Render(context.Background(), os.Stdout)
}
```
When you compile and run it you should see
```shell
go run .
<h1>Welcome to yet emerging technologies, sebastien</h1>
```
Writing HTML snippets on `Stdout` isn't a dream job so let's instead serve it thru HTTP using the `net/http` package
```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"

  "github.com/a-h/templ"
)

func main() {
  component := welcome("sebastien")

  http.Handle("/", templ.Handler(component))

  fmt.Println("Listening on :3000")
  http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil)
}
```
Test it to see if everything looks good ?
```shell
curl http://localhost:3000
<div>Welcome to yet emerging technologies, sebastien</div>
```
Our Hello world works great! As you've seen, `templ` generates functions that output your snippets. Remember that you can benefit from the power of Go in your template (`if`, `switch`, etc...).

`templ` files can also contain call to other components or Go code to implement some logic processing outside the `templ` declaration which will be considered as Go ordinary code.

So to summarize, components are markup and Go code that is compiled into Go functions that return a `templ.Component` interface by running the `templ generate` command.

### Syntax cheatsheet
- All Tags must be close: `<br/>`, `<div></div>`, `<button></button>`
- `strings` values are automatically escaped (security measure)
	- `&` characters in the URL are escaped to `&amp;`.
	- `"` characters are escaped to `&quot;`.
	- `'` characters are escaped to `&#39;`.
- It's possible to use function calls in components string attribute expressions

Below you'll find a cheatsheet of what can be used within the `templ`  declaration.

| tag                   | description                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{  variable }`       | replaced by received value for variable                           |
| `@component`          | call a component or inject the rendered output of a component h   |
| `function` call       | need to return `string` or `(string, error)`                      |
| `?={ true \| false }` | only output preceding attribute if true                           |
| `if/else`             | reserved keywords, Capitalize or put in String to avoid statement |
| `switch`              | reserved keywords, Capitalize or put in String to avoid statement |
| `for`                 | reserved keywords, Capitalize or put in String to avoid statement |
| `{{ ... }}`           | raw go to be excuted                                              |

### Web Application Structure
Hopefully you should now have a better understanding of the usefulness of this templating engine, let's share what is the recommended [structure](https://templ.guide/project-structure/project-structure) for a web app using this module. [Counter](https://github.com/a-h/templ/tree/main/examples/counter), available in the repository is a good example of that.

- All of you components should live in their own `components` package.
- Database related interactions are also in their own `db` package
- Same for your `handlers`, `services` used by your handlers and `session` which implement HTTP session IDs

Finally a `main.go` will glue all of that together. So the directory structure should look something like that
```
components/
db/
handlers/
services/
session
```

### `{ attrMap... }`
By using a syntax like `{ attrMap... }` it becomes possible to spread any variable of type `templ.Attributes` a `map[string]any` type definition. Quite useful to define a list of arguments in a single map which will be spread out when generating the component. The way it will be spread out depends on the type of values within the key of the map. Let see what will happen for each types

- if value is a `string`: `<div name="value">`
- if value is a `bool`: `<div name>` if true
- if value is a `templ.KeyValue[string, bool]`: `<div name="value"> if true
- if value `templ.KeyValue[bool, bool]`: `<div name>` if both true

### URLs
`href` require a `templ.SafeURL` instead of just a string, you can use `templ.URL` to sanitizes your string
```html
templ component(p Person) {
<a href={ templ.URL(p.URL) }>{ strings.ToUpper(p.Name) }</a>
}
```
Also URLs sanitised used outside of `href` or `<form action=""` should be converted back to strings
```html
<div hx-get={ string(templ.URL(fmt.Sprintf("/contacts/%s/email", contact.ID)))}>
```
### Composition
Imagine you have a layout that you want to apply to all your pages
```html
templ heading() {
	<h1>Heading</h1>
}

templ layout(contents templ.Component) {
	<div id="heading">
		@heading()
	</div>
	<div id="contents">
		@contents
	</div>
}

templ paragraph(contents string) {
<p>{ contents }</p>
}
```
You can now inject your content into your `layout`
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	c := paragraph("Dynamic contents")
	layout(c).Render(context.Background(), os.Stdout)
}
```
you can also pass `templ` components as parameters to other components
```go
templ root() {
	@layout(paragraph("Dynamic contents"))
}
```
components can be joined together
```go
templ helloWorld() {
	@templ.Join(hello(), world())
}
```
If you want to reuse a component outside it's package, it's first letter should be a capital letter.
package components

```html
Package components

templ Hello() {
	<div>Hello</div>
}
```

### Importing Javascript
To import Javacript you just have to add something like that in your head component.
```html
templ head() {
	<head>
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/lightweightcharts/dist/lightweight-charts.standalone.production.js"></script>
	</head>
}
```
You can then use the imported JavaScript in any templ via a `<script>` tag.

To serve the file you can assign a new Handler for your static assets and serve it, all of that using the `net/http` standard library.
```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.Handle("/assets/", http.StripPrefix("/assets/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("assets"))))
http.ListenAndServe("localhost:8080", mux)
```

### Importing HTMX
[HTMX](https://htmx.org/) can be used to selectively replace content within a web page. To make it available to your project you just have to download `htmx.min.js` and serve it. You can then add a `<script>` tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML, like we've shown above.
```
<script src="/assets/js/htmx.min.js"></script>
```

### Context
allows to pass parameters down the chain of components using the implicit `ctx` variable
```
// Define the context key type.
type contextKey string

// Create a context key for the theme.
var themeContextKey contextKey = "theme"

// Create a context variable that inherits from a parent, and sets the value "test".
ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), themeContextKey, "test")

// Pass the ctx variable to the render function.
themeName().Render(ctx, w)
```
it is then accessible from within components like thtat
```html
templ themeName() {
	<div>{ ctx.Value(themeContextKey).(string) }</div>
}
```

I know I said simple static page, but remember that your Go code will be statically compiled, so all these dependencies are hidden from your end user. At least we know the building blocks of templ. I always like to break things down to understand the inner workings of things. Iif you ever want to see the above list of dependencies, enter the module and run

```
go list -m all
```
I hope this article was useful, I'll experiment more and may update this article in the future.
