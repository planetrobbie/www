When it comes to Integrated Development Environments (IDE), there are so many choices it's easy to get lost. In my case, I'm always looking for simplicity, command line interface and open source, so with these criteria in mind I ended up choosing [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my main editor with [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) to help me configure a full-blown IDE on top of it. In particular, in this blog post I'll show you how to set it up for [Golang](https://go.dev/) development on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
### Installation of Neovim

Let start by installing the latest version of Neovim which is 0.10.2-2 at the time of this writing, version 0.10 or later is required for NvChad to work properly.

```
pacman -S neovim
```

On MacOS you can run

```
brew install neovim
```
### Dependencies
First, make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed on our system:

- Nerd fonts - a collection of modified fonts for developers
- gopls - the most used language server for Go.
- Ripgrep (optional for grep searching with Telescope)
- gcc
- make

```
sudo pacman -S $(pacman -Sgq nerd-fonts)
sudo pacman -S gopls ripgrep gcc make
```
### Installation of NvChad
**[NvChad](https://nvchad.com/)** is a modern, customisable and fast **Neovim configuration ** built using **Lua**. It's quite useful for being more productive when using Neovim, so let's install it with this simple command

```
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/starter ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```

This command simply clones the NvChad config to `~/.config/nvim' and runs `nvvim'.  When the editor starts, it will automatically install the following plugins

- base64 - for theme management
- NvChad - basic configuration that allow the user configuration to be entered into NeoVim
- nvim-treesitter - for analysis and highlighting of code
- ui - the editor interface (statusline, tabufline..)

And many more by leveraging [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) package manager.

If you're curious You can access the documentation to learn about NvChad's base46 and UI

```
:h nvui
```

For example you can now bring the **theme switcher** with `[space] t h` I'm using **gruvbox**

Now you need to configure Neovim to use `gopls` by editing

```
vi ~/.config/nvim/lua/configs/lspconfig.lua
lspconfig.gopls.setup({
    cmd = { "gopls" },
    filetypes = { "go", "gomod", "gowork", "gotmpl" },
    root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern("go.work", "go.mod", ".git"),
    settings = {
        gopls = {
            analyses = {
                unusedparams = true,
            },
            staticcheck = true,
		completeUnimported = true,
	    usePlaceholders = true,
        },
    },
})
```

- `completeUnimported` auto import what's required by your code 
- `unusedparams` alert if you declare something but have don't use it.

For the best development experience, ensure you have tools like `goimports` or `gofumpt` installed:

```
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
go install mvdan.cc/gofumpt@latest
```

You can add custom keymappings

```
vi mappings.lua
map("n", "<leader>fm", ":lua vim.lsp.buf.format()<CR>", { desc = "Format Golang code" })
map("n", "gd",  "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()<CR>", { desc = "Go to Definition"})
map("n","gr", "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.references()<CR>", { desc = "Find References"})
map("n", "K", "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>", { desc = "Hover Documentation"})
map("n", "<leader>ca", "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action()<CR>", {desc = "Code Action" })
map("n", "<leader>rn", "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.rename()<CR>", {desc ="Rename Symbol"})
```

### Mason.nvim
Most of the info online is now obsolete regarding adding key mappings you now have to follow the vim format as described above.
For Neovim to become an IDE we need to interact with a Language Server (LSP) to format, lint and debug code. So let us set up a tool called [Mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) which will be used to manage LSPs and other development tools. Install it from Neovim with this command

```
:MasonInstallAll
```

It will install the following additional packages
- css-lsp
- html-lsp
- lua-language-server
- stylua
But `Mason.nvim` provides many more options.
### gopls
You should now be able to open some go code and check that you indeed have LSP available
```
nvim main.go
:LspInfo
```

You should see [gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls) listed as the active server, if that's the case you're ready to code.
### Cheatsheet

#### General
- `CTRL n` bring file explorer
- `:e tab or <path>` open a file, navigate list with tab
- `:split` - Open the file in an horizontal split screen.
- `:vsplit` - Open the file in a vertical split screen.
- `:tabedit` - Open the file in a new tab.

#### Golang `space`
- `fm` format Golang code
- `gd` go to Definition
- `gr` find References
- `K` hover Documentation
- `ca` code action
- `rn` rename symbol
#### Telescope `space`
- `ff` find files
- `fh` help files
- `:Telescope fd` access [Telescope's](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) find file feature
#### Moving around `ctrl`
- `b` to go to the beginning of the line
- e` to go to the end of the lineL
- `]` enter a tag
#### LazyVim
- `:Lazy` access Lazy package manager
- `:Lazy update [plugins]` update plugins
- `<CR>` on a plugin to see its details
- `K` open plugin link
#### Customize Hotkeys
Keep in mind the following while setting up new hotkeys in `~/.config/nvim/lua/configs/mappings.lua` the new syntax is

```
map("<n|i|v|c>","<key combinaison>", "<cmd><CMD><CR>", { desc = "<DESCRIPTION>"})
```

- mode can be: **n**ormal, **i**nsert, **v**isual or **c**ommand line
- key combinaison can contain:
	- `leader` = Space
	- `A` = Alt
	- `C` = Ctrl
	- `S` = Shift
- `<cmd><CR> `command to execute
- `desc` document the mapping, shown on helpful on-screen display
### Troubleshooting
- make sure gopls is in your path
- If you can't get LSP to work you can watch the log with `:LspLog
- if you can the error  `No package found for open file` make sure you've opened the file from the root directory of your project, you can check that with `:pwd`
	- if it's a module, ensure your project is inside a Go module run `go mod init <module name>`
	- if the file already exist check its validity `go mod tidy`
