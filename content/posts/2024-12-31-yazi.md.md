I've been using [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/) for years and I still enjoy it pretty much. The first time I've seen a file manager using the multi-column layout was on NeXTSTEP operating system. It was pretty smart, I felt in love with this operating system. When I first used [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) it reminded me of the early days of this OS who hasn't been around long enough for my taste. So let me introduce you to yazi, a terminal based multi-column file manager written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## cheatsheet
Let me start by the most important shortcuts for day to day use.

| shortcuts | description |
| --- | --- |
| `~` | help |
| `.` | toggle hidden files |
| `g` | go to ? |
| `space` | toggle selection |
| `esc` | cancel selection |
| `z, Z` | using zoxide, fzf to jump to a directory |
| `v, V` | enter visual modew (selection, unset) |
| `y, Y` | copy, cancel |
| `x, X` | cut, cancel |
| `p, P` | paste, overwrite if exist |
| `d, D` | trash, permanently delete |
| `r` | rename |
| `f` | filter |
| `/, ?` | find next, previous |
| `n, N` | go to next, previous |
| `s, S` | search by name, content |
| `, s S e E m M` | sort by size, extension, modified time (reverse) |
| `t` | create a tab |
| `1, 2, ...` | move to corresponding tab |
| `[ ]` | switch to previous, next tab |
| `ctrl + c` | close tab |
| `T` | toggle preview zoom (plugin) |

## Installation

On macOS

```shell
brew install yazi fzf zoxide glow
```

On Arch Linux

```shell
sudo pacman -S yazi ffmpeg p7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide imagemagick glow
```

To quit it and stay in the current directory, add the following lines to your ```~/.zshrc```

```shell
#Yazi - allows to keep dir location when existing with q otherwise use Q
function y() {
        local tmp="$(mktemp -t "yazi-cwd.XXXXXX")" cwd
        yazi "$@" --cwd-file="$tmp"
        if cwd="$(command cat -- "$tmp")" && [ -n "$cwd" ] && [ "$cwd" != "$PWD" ]; then
                builtin cd -- "$cwd"
        fi
        rm -f -- "$tmp"
}
```

Now to integrate with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) you can also add

```shell
#fzf - Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
source <(fzf --zsh)

#zoxide - better cd
eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"
```

After ```source ~/.zshrc``` you can launch it

```shell
y
```

## Plugins

One of the beauty of yazi is his ability to be extended with plugins. In my case I've installed the following ones

```shell
# to add border
ya pack -a yazi-rs/plugins:full-border

# to show git status
ya pack -a yazi-rs/plugins:git

# allow to zoom into preview with T
ya pack -a yazi-rs/plugins:max-preview

# required to preview Markdown files
ya pack -a Reledia/glow
```

Once installed you have to tweak your configuration files

```shell
# enable borders and git plugins
vi  ~/.config/yazi/init.lua
require("full-border"):setup()
require("git"):setup()

# keymap configuration for max-preview
vi ~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on   = "T"
run  = "plugin max-preview"
desc = "Maximize or restore preview"

# general configuration for git and md previewing
vi ~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml
[[plugin.prepend_fetchers]]
id   = "git"
name = "*"
run  = "git"

[plugin]
prepend_previewers = [
  { name = "*.md", run = "glow" },
]
```

You're almost done. If you are running yazi on macOS you can configure it to launch the native quickview by adding in your ```keymap.toml```

```shell
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = "<C-p>"
run = '''
  shell 'qlmanage -p "$@"'
'''
```

Enjoy yazi.


## What's missing

When comparing with Midnight Commander the most important missing feature for me, is the ability to connect to remove machines to easily swap files. It seems it's in the [roadmap](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/611) of yazi, so hopefully I may replace MC on most of my use cases. But I think I'll still use it on my NAS, MC works better there because of less [dependencies](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/installation) required.
