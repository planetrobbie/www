Some tools just refuse to die and remain useful for years. [Pet](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet) is a really good example. I've been using it for over 6 years and is still be maintained by its creator, Teppei Fukuda, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart for creating such a great little thing.

The pet binary, available for most operating systems, gives you an infinite number of configurable shortcuts to commonly used shell commands. This can be anything from launching an SSH tunnel to starting containers. All you have to do is configure the commands in its configuration file `~/.config/pet/snippet.toml`, which can be committed to a git repository for easy sharing between your different machines.

In this article, I'll show you the most important ways to use Pet, which can quickly become your best shell friend.

### Installation
It's as simple as putting the [pet binary](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet/releases) in your path, some Linux distributions may already have a package for it, prefer this way if applicable. On MacOS you can run

`brew install knqyf263/pet/pet`

Homebrew install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) dependency, if installing by other means make sure you have it as well.

Once you have it in your path, the next thing to do is to configure your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for quick access to Pet main features.

To easily add a previously executed command as a Pet snippet.

```shell
function prev() {
  PREV=$(fc -lrn | head -n 1)
  sh -c "pet new `printf %q "$PREV"`"
}
```

To access your commands just by using `CTRL-S` on zsh

```shell
function pet-select() {
  BUFFER=$(pet search --query "$LBUFFER")
  CURSOR=$#BUFFER
  zle redisplay
}
zle -N pet-select
stty -ixon
bindkey '^s' pet-select
```

on bash

```shell
cat .bashrc
function pet-select() {
  BUFFER=$(pet search --query "$READLINE_LINE")
  READLINE_LINE=$BUFFER
  READLINE_POINT=${#BUFFER}
}
bind -x '"\C-x\C-r": pet-select'
```

### Pet Commands
cli | description
-- | -- | --
`pet search` or `CTRL-s` | Search for a command
`pet new -t` | Create a new command with a tags space separated
`pet edit` | Edit Commands
`pet list` | List all existing commands
`pet exec` | Execute a command
`pet clip` | Copy the selected commands
`pet sync` | Sync up to the configured Gist
`pet configure` | Configure
`pet list -t $tag` | Filter snippets by tags

### Pet Tips & Tricks

In your Pet configuration file, variables can be used in commands between `<` and `>` ; like this

    git remote add origin git@github.com:planetrobbie/<REPO=default_value>.git

By using `pbcopy` on OS X, you can copy snippets to clipboard to run a command remotely using a SSH connection, you'll be able to paste the command from the clipboard.

    pet search | pbcopy

### Pet Configuration

You can configure the location of your snippet file, just run `pet configure` and add the following section

```
[General]
snippetfile = "/home/<user>/.config/pet/snippet.toml"
```

Snippets are locally stored but Pet can be configured to sync them via Gist or GitHub. First get an access token from [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).

Now add one of the following code depending if you prefer Gist of GitLab

```
[Gist]
  file_name = "pet-snippet.toml"  # specify gist file name
  access_token = ""               # your access token
  gist_id = ""                    # Gist ID
  public = false                  # public or priate
  auto_sync = false               # sync automatically when editing snippets

[GitLab]
  file_name = "pet-snippet.toml"  # specify GitLab Snippets file name
  access_token = ""               # your access token
  id = ""                         # GitLab Snippets ID
  visibility = "private"          # public or internal or private
  auto_sync = false               # sync automatically when editing snippets
```

If you set `auto_sync` to true, Pet will be automatically sync'ed after addition

To conclude this article please find below a snippet example

```
[[snippets]]
  command = "echo | openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 2>/dev/null |openssl x509 -dates -noout"
  description = "Show expiration date of SSL certificate"
  output = """
```

Have fun with your Pet.
